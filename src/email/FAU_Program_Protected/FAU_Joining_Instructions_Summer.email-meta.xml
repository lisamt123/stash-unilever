Hi everyone,


Thank you for joining the induction calls. For those who weren’t able to join, let me know if you would like a quick call.


Attached here are the presentation deck with the program overview and important information, and the 1-page tracker/checklist containing pre-work requirements. As shared during the call, we strongly encourage you to set aside time for the EDP (as per scheduled sessions with YSC) and personal reflection (2-3 hours), and take full advantage of the program as part of your personal development.



I will set up the Chatter group soon, which is here : {!FAU_Participant__c.FAU_Chatter_Group__c}


Please note again the following dates:


{!FAU_Participant__c.FAU_Module_1_Start_Date__c - 7}: deadline to submit travel details and bio

Please goto {!FAU_Participant__c.FAU_Participants_Workbook__c} and update details.





What’s coming next:

The first residential module will be on from {!FAU_Participant__c.FAU_Module_1_Start_Date__c} to {!FAU_Participant__c.FAU_Module_1_End_Date__c}.





Kind regards,
