    <subject>Your Project {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Project_Name__c} is Unarchiving</subject>
    <textOnly>The Local Rollout Leader {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Project_Leader__c} has chosen to cancel the stoppage of {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Project_Name__c}. Therefore {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Project_Name__c} will remain part of the rollout plan of {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Parent_Project_Name__c}. If you disagree with this cancellation please contact {!IPM_Project__c.IPM_Project_Leader__c} to come to an agreement. Please note that you can start the stopping procedure at any time before [Local Project Name] has approved the Market Deployment Gate.</textOnly>
